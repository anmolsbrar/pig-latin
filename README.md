#### Description and Features:

When converting from english to pig latin, the consonant cluster is basically moved to the end of the word, and adds "-ay". However, if a letter begins with a vowel, just add "-ay" to the end of word. 
While converting from pig latin to english, the program skips to the hyphen "-" and removes "ay", then moves rest the characters to the front of the word.
This process is repeated until whole sentence is processed.

* Easy to understand coding. (I have written this code for easy understandability).
